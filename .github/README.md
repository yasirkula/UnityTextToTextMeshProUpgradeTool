This asset helps you upgrade the **Text**, **InputField**, **Dropdown** and **TextMesh** objects in your projects to their **TextMesh Pro** variants. It also upgrades the scripts so that e.g. `Text` variables in those scripts become `TMP_Text` variables. Then, it reconnects the references to the upgraded components (e.g. if a public variable was referencing an upgraded *Text* component, it will now reference the corresponding *TextMeshProUGUI* component).

## INSTALLATION

There are 5 ways to install this plugin:

- import [TextToTMP.unitypackage](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityTextToTextMeshProUpgradeTool/releases) via *Assets-Import Package*
- clone/[download](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityTextToTextMeshProUpgradeTool/archive/master.zip) this repository and move the *Plugins* folder to your Unity project's *Assets* folder
- import it from [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/text-to-textmesh-pro-upgrade-tool-176732)
- *(via Package Manager)* add the following line to *Packages/manifest.json*:
  - `"com.yasirkula.texttotmp": "https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityTextToTextMeshProUpgradeTool.git",`
- *(via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com))* after installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
  - `openupm add com.yasirkula.texttotmp`

## HOW TO

Before proceeding, **you are strongly recommended to backup your project**; just in case.

- Open the **Window-Upgrade Text to TMP** window
- Add the prefabs, Scenes, scripts and ScriptableObjects to upgrade to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list (if you add a folder there, its whole contents will be upgraded)(ScriptableObjects' *Font* variables will be upgraded). If an Object wasn't added to that list but it had references to the upgraded components, those references will be lost
- To determine which Unity *Fonts* will be upgraded to which TextMesh Pro *FontAssets*, use the **Font Upgrades** list
- Hit **START** and then follow the presented instructions. To summarize:
  - **Step 1/3: Upgrading Scripts:** Decide which scripts should be upgraded; e.g. `Text` variables in those scripts will become `TMP_Text` variables
  - **Step 2/3: Upgrading Components:** Decide which prefabs/Scenes should be upgraded; e.g. *Text* components in those prefabs/Scenes will be upgraded to *TextMeshProUGUI* components
  - **Step 3/3: Reconnecting References:** Decide whether or not the references to the upgraded components should be restored; e.g. if a public variable was referencing an upgraded *Text* component, it will now reference the corresponding *TextMeshProUGUI* component

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- `InputField.onSubmit` event isn't serialized on TMP_InputField so in order not to lose references to its listeners, [TMP_InputFieldOnSubmitEvent](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityTextToTextMeshProUpgradeTool/blob/master/Plugins/TextToTMP/Other/TMP_InputFieldOnSubmitEvent.cs) component will be attached to the upgraded InputField objects with non-empty onSubmit events automatically. It means that if you delete this plugin after the upgrade process, all instances of that component (if any) will be broken. However, you can duplicate the TMP_InputFieldOnSubmitEvent script, delete the plugin, and then change the duplicated script's GUID to the [original script's GUID](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityTextToTextMeshProUpgradeTool/blob/master/Plugins/TextToTMP/Other/TMP_InputFieldOnSubmitEvent.cs.meta) to restore those references, if you wish
- If an InputField or Dropdown prefab instance's UnityEvent is modified (i.e. it's different from the prefab asset), that modification can't be restored after the upgrade process on Unity 2019.2 or earlier if a script was modified during the upgrade process

## EXAMPLES

### Upgrading [RuntimeInspector](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeInspector)

Add `Plugins/RuntimeInspector` folder to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list and then upgrade everything (scripts, components, references). No manual intervention necessary.

### Upgrading [IngameDebugConsole](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityIngameDebugConsole)

Add `Plugins/IngameDebugConsole` folder to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list and then upgrade everything. No manual intervention necessary.

**NOTE:** As of v1.8.0, IngameDebugConsole uses TextMesh Pro by default.

### Upgrading [DynamicPanels](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityDynamicPanels)

Add `Plugins/DynamicPanels` folder to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list and then upgrade everything. While upgrading the scripts, *DynamicPanelsCanvasEditor.cs* will throw a compiler error. Fix it as follows before proceeding to upgrade the components:

```csharp
anchoredPanelGUIStyle = new GUIStyle( "box" )
{
	alignment = TextAnchor.MiddleCenter, // <-- Changed here to TextAnchor.MiddleCenter
	clipping = TextClipping.Clip
};
```

**What happened:** While UI system uses `TextAnchor`, TMP uses `TextAlignmentOptions`. The plugin assumed that it was upgrading a `Text`'s *alignment* property here but it was actually breaking a `GUIStyle`'s *alignment* property. While upgrading the scripts, the plugin doesn't use advanced stuff like lexers in order to avoid any 3rd party dependencies. However, this can result in rare false positives like this.

### Upgrading [SimpleFileBrowser](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnitySimpleFileBrowser)

Add `Plugins/SimpleFileBrowser` folder to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list and then upgrade everything. No manual intervention necessary.

**NOTE:** As of v1.7.0, SimpleFileBrowser uses TextMesh Pro by default.

### Upgrading [ImageCropper](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityImageCropper)

Add `Plugins/ImageCropper` folder to the **Assets & Scenes To Upgrade** list and then upgrade everything. While upgrading the scripts, *FontSizeSynchronizer.cs* will throw a compiler error. Fix it as follows before proceeding to upgrade the components:

```csharp
private void Awake()
{
	if( texts.Length == 0 )
		return;

	canvas = texts[0].canvas;

	initialBestFitSizes = new int[texts.Length];
	for( int i = 0; i < texts.Length; i++ )
		initialBestFitSizes[i] = (int) texts[i].fontSizeMax; // <-- Added (int) typecast here
}

// Credit: https://forum.unity.com/threads/textmeshpro-precull-dorebuilds-performance.762968/#post-5083490
public void Synchronize()
{
	if( canvas == null || !gameObject.activeInHierarchy )
		return;

	int minSize = int.MaxValue;
	for( int i = 0; i < texts.Length; i++ )
	{
		TMPro.TMP_Text text = texts[i];

		text.fontSizeMax = initialBestFitSizes[i];
		text.enableAutoSizing = true;
		text.ForceMeshUpdate();

		int fontSize = (int) text.fontSize;
		if( fontSize < minSize )
			minSize = fontSize;
	}

	for( int i = 0; i < texts.Length; i++ )
	{
		texts[i].fontSize = minSize;
		texts[i].enableAutoSizing = false;
	}
}
```

**What happened:** Previously, we were using `TextGenerator` to calculate the *Best Fit* font size but TextMesh Pro doesn't use TextGenerator, so we had to upgrade this function manually.
