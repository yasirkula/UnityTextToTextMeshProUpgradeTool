  "description": "This asset helps you upgrade the Text, InputField, Dropdown and TextMesh objects in your projects to their TextMesh Pro variants. It also upgrades the scripts so that e.g. Text variables in those scripts become TMP_Text variables. Then, it reconnects the references to the upgraded components (e.g. if a public variable was referencing an upgraded Text component, it will now reference the corresponding TextMeshProUGUI component)."
